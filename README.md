# Fedora-42-Linux-Final-
Final Project for CIS 2023 Linux Final

The purpose of this project is to see if we understand on how to connect a Linux terminal to Github and write a bash script on how auto count from 1 to 50.
The first step on our journey for this project is to setup a GitHub repository and connect it to a SSH key.
Once we have accomplished this task our next step is to create a bash script to run the count and have it printed.
All of this is to show our knowledge we have learned in the class to understand parts of Linux and making it easier to show our professor on what we have learned.
