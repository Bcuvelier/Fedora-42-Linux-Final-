# Fedora-42-Linux-Final-
Final Project for CIS 2023 Linux Final

The first thing I did when I started my project is by creating a Github and getting my SSH key. The script I ran is shown Below.
<code style="color : red">ssh-keygen -o</code>
Then I created a passphrase so that only ones who can use the SSh key would be those who know the passphrase.
Then I imputed the SSH key into Githubs SSH key setting under the users profile.
